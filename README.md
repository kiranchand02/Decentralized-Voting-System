# Decentralized-Voting-System-Using-Ethereum-Blockchain

Conventional voting systems rely on centralized authorities, which can lead to issues such as lack of transparency, single points of failure, and potential manipulation.
This project leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to create a decentralized voting platform where votes are recorded immutably and verified publicly without compromising voter privacy.

# Objectives

-Build a trustless and transparent voting system

-Ensure immutability of votes using blockchain

-Eliminate centralized control

-Explore Ethereum smart contracts in real world applications

-Provide a secure and verifiable election process

# Features

-Implements JWT for secure voter authentication and authorization

-Immutable and tamper-proof vote storage

-Secure voter registration and authentication
  
-Fully decentralized architecture

-Admin panel to manage candidates, set voting dates, and monitor results

# Tech Stack

-Blockchain: Ethereum

-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

-Web3 Integration: Web3.js / Ethers.js

-Wallet: MetaMask

-Development Tools: Ganache

# System Architecture

-Smart contracts manage voter registration, voting, and result calculation

-Votes are stored as transactions on the Ethereum blockchain

-Each vote is immutable and publicly verifiable

-MetaMask is used to sign and authorize transactions

-No central authority controls the voting process

# How It Works

-Voter connects wallet using MetaMask

-Voter registers through a smart contract

-Vote is cast and sent as a blockchain transaction

-Smart contract validates and records the vote

-Results are fetched directly from the blockchain

# Learning Outcomes

-Hands on experience with Ethereum blockchain

-Understanding decentralized application (DApp) architecture

-Integrating blockchain with frontend applications

# Future Enhancements

-Deploying smart contracts on Ethereum testnet/mainnet

-Advanced voter identity verification

-Gas optimization for smart contracts

-Improved UI/UX design

-Multi-election support
